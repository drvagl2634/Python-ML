    "- Bagging trains multiple models independently in parallel on different random subsets of the data (with replacement), and then combines their outputs, usually by voting or averaging.\n",
    "Boosting, on the other hand, trains models sequentially, where each new model tries to fix the errors made by the previous ones. So, bagging reduces variance, while boosting focuses more on reducing bias.\n"

    "\n",
    "- Random Forest is basically a collection of decision trees trained on different random subsets of the data and features. By averaging the predictions of many uncorrelated trees, it cancels out the noise and overfitting that a single decision tree might have — which helps reduce variance and improves generalization.\n"
